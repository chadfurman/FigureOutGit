# Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string it
# is passed is strong. A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight
# characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, and has at
# least one digit. You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to
# validate its strength.
